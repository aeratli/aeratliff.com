			<div class="tab-content" id="about-content">
				<h1>About</h1>
				<p>Born and raised on the island of Oahu, Hawaii, Anthony's fascination with technology began early, with an interest in web design, 3D modeling, and media production. Entering high school, he was among the first generation to participate in his alma mater's pilot Cisco CCNA/P and A+ prep course programs, igniting a lifelong passion for the world of IT and cybersecurity.</p>
				<p>Pursuing a deeper understanding of technology, he enrolled in college, majoring in Information & Computer Sciences with a focus on Software Engineering and Data Structures. During this time, he honed his skills in software development, networking, and systems engineering.</p>
				<p>Eager to put his newly acquired skills to the test, Anthony enlisted in the United States Air Force, where they served for 10 years as a Network Intelligence Analyst. Their assignments spanned 11 geographically distinct and operationally unique missions across the US, including Joint-Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, HI, Pensacola, FL, Ft. Meade, MD, & Ft. Gordon, GA among several others, providing invaluable experience in IT foundations, cybersecurity, and military intelligence. These diverse assignments helped shape his expertise in both the technical and strategic elements of cybersecurity.</p>
				<p>To provide a more stable family life, he transitioned out of the Active Duty Air Force into the Air National Guard where he continued his service in the Cyber Intelligence domain while pursuing civilian cybersecurity roles. Based in the East Bay Area and later the greater Sacramento area, he worked in various blue/purple team cybersecurity roles within the healthcare and managed service security provider (MSSP) sectors, leading critical cybersecurity operations and incident response teams.</p>
				<p>Some of Anthony's unclassified key exploits include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Security Operations Lead: Designing, implementing, and managing security stacks across all security domains, integrating tools with SIEM and SOAR platforms, and creating efficient workflows to streamline incident response.</li>
					<li>SIEM-SOAR Lead: Leading the design, implementation, and tuning of SIEM infrastructure, including migrating from Splunk to Microsoft Sentinel while minimizing impact to legacy systems. Anthony introduced AI-based analytics and self-tuning SIEM processes to optimize threat detection and response.</li>
					<li>SOC Incident Response Lead: Developing engineering-centric processes for SOC teams, ensuring effective incident triage and response through a combination of training, tooling, and coordination with stakeholders.</li>
					<li>Email Security Operations Lead: Managing the security of a 25K mailbox MS365 Exchange hybrid environment, implementing advanced email security tools, and leading email domain brand protection initiatives, including DMARC reporting and email relay remediation.</li>
					<li>Endpoint Security Operations Lead: Overseeing the security and compliance of a mixed Windows/Linux environment, swapping legacy security tools for more efficient and cost-effective solutions like Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, while addressing compliance gaps and endpoint security issues.</li>
					<li>Cloud Security Operations Lead: Leading the implementation of Azure and AWS resources, integrating cloud security policies, and supporting cloud migration efforts while improving security posture and disaster recovery capabilities.</li>
					<li>TVM Lead: Managing vulnerability management tools like Rapid7 InsightVM, ensuring continuous vulnerability scanning and remediation for 25K assets, and spearheading penetration testing and vulnerability management efforts.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>With a strong background in systems and security engineering, he has developed expertise in a wide range of tools and technologies, including SIEM-SOAR platforms, endpoint security, email and identity management, vulnerability management, and cloud security. They are well-versed in working with organizations across various industries, particularly healthcare, to provide robust cybersecurity solutions and strategies that meet complex compliance requirements.</p>
				<p>Anthony has a deep technical knowledge base, which includes working with systems like Splunk ES, Microsoft Sentinel, Azure Defender for Cloud, Cisco Firepower, Rapid7 InsightVM, and more. Additionally, their proficiency in programming and scripting languages, such as Python, Powershell, Bash, and SQL, ensures they can build, maintain, and optimize cybersecurity workflows tailored to each organizationâ€™s unique needs.</p>
				<p>Beyond their technical prowess, Anthony remains committed to fostering a proactive cybersecurity culture, focusing on education, team training, and process optimization to ensure organizations remain secure against evolving threats. Their career continues to be driven by a passion for technology, a desire for ongoing learning, and a dedication to securing the digital world for the next generation.</p>
